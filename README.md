# LegalCaseTextClassification

1. Abstract:

	Reading whole legal case document and 

2. Objective

	 Built end-to-end development of machine learning algorithms as base-line models.

4. Tasks: 

  	a. Cleansed data using data preprocessing techniques to make data useful for machine learning models.
	
  	b. Encoded the text data using TF-IDF and Word2vector to make appropriate inputs for predictive models.
	
  	c. Built all classification ML algorithms such as logistic regression, SVM, LGBM,..etc. 
	
  	d. Evaluated the all the models' performance based on TF-IDF and word2vector approaches.
